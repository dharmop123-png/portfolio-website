## 📋 Step 1: Prepare Images (IMPORTANT!)

Before deploying, you MUST save these images to the `public` folder:

### How to Save Images:

1. **Open File Explorer**
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\dharm\OneDrive\Desktop\My Projects\Portfoliodream\portfolio-react\public\`
3. Save these files (right-click images from chat → Save As):

   | File Name | Description |
   |-----------|-------------|
   | `green-haven-screenshot.png` | Green Haven project screenshot |
   | `raahi-screenshot.png` | Raahi AI Travel Planner screenshot |
   | `portfolio-screenshot.png` | Your portfolio homepage screenshot |
   | `freelancing-screenshot.png` | SkillYatra freelancing platform screenshot |
   | `coders-circle-logo.png` | Coders Circle logo (green/orange H) |
   | `Dharmendra_Kumar_Resume.pdf` | Your resume PDF |
   | `dharmendra-photo.jpg` | Your profile photo (founder) |
   | `ujjwal-photo.jpg` | Co-founder profile photo |

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: File names must match EXACTLY (including capital letters, dashes, and extensions)!

## 📦 Step 2: Install Git (if not installed)

### Check if Git is installed:
```powershell
git --version
```

If you see a version number, **skip to Step 3**.

### If Git is NOT installed:
1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download "64-bit Git for Windows Setup"
3. Run the installer
4. Keep clicking "Next" with default settings
5. Click "Install"
6. Restart VS Code terminal

---

## 🔧 Step 3: Initialize Git Repository

Open VS Code terminal (View → Terminal) and run these commands ONE BY ONE:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project folder
cd "C:\Users\dharm\OneDrive\Desktop\My Projects\Portfoliodream\portfolio-react"

# Initialize Git
git init

# Check status
git status
```

---

## 📝 Step 4: Create .gitignore File

1. In VS Code, create a new file in the `portfolio-react` folder
2. Name it: `.gitignore` (starts with a dot!)
3. Paste this content:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build output
dist/
build/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
```

4. Save the file (Ctrl + S)

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit Your Code

Run these commands in VS Code terminal:

```powershell
# Add all files to Git
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete portfolio website"

# Check commit was successful
git log --oneline
```

You should see your commit message!

## 🌐 Step 6: Create GitHub Repository

### 6.1 Go to GitHub
1. Open browser: https://github.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Click the **"+"** icon (top right)
4. Click **"New repository"**

### 6.2 Repository Settings
- **Repository name**: `portfolio-website` (or any name you like)

- **Visibility**: ✅ Public (so anyone can see it)
- ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
- ❌ **DO NOT** add .gitignore
- ❌ **DO NOT** choose a license
- Click **"Create repository"**

### 6.3 Connect Local Code to GitHub

GitHub will show you commands. Copy them and run in VS Code terminal:

```powershell
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio-website.git

# Check remote was added
git remote -v

# Push code to GitHub
git branch -M main
